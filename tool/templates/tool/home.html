    <h2>What a Viva Looks Like</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
        A structured, text-based viva delivered through a clean chat interface.
        The AI asks outcome-aligned questions based on the student's submitted work.

                    In your essay you argue that rewilding improves ecological resilience. 
                    What specific mechanisms support that claim?
                </div>

                <div class="mockup-bubble user">
                    One mechanism is trophic cascade restoration. For example, reintroducing predators 
                    helps regulate herbivore populations, which reduces overgrazing.
                </div>

                <div class="mockup-bubble ai">
                    That’s a good start. Could you explain how those cascading effects contribute 
                    to long-term ecosystem stability?
                </div>

                <div class="mockup-bubble user">
                    By balancing population sizes, vegetation recovers, which stabilises soil and 
                    increases biodiversity. This makes the system more resilient to shocks.
                </div>

                <div class="mockup-bubble ai">
                    What do you consider the strongest counter-argument against rewilding 
                    in densely populated regions of the UK?
                </div>

                <div class="mockup-bubble user">
                    Probably concerns about land-use conflict — especially where communities rely 
                    on intensive agriculture or livestock grazing.

    <h2>How VivaNoodle Works</h2>

    <div class="how-grid">

        <div class="how-card">
            <div class="how-number">1</div>
            <h3>Instructor Creates Assignment</h3>
            <p>
                Instructors configure the Viva directly inside the VLE — defining learning outcomes, tone, 
                transparency settings, and viva duration.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-card">
            <div class="how-number">2</div>
            <h3>Student Submits Their Work</h3>
            <p>
                Students upload or enter their assignment materials as normal, forming the basis for the
                ensuing viva conversation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-card">
            <div class="how-number">3</div>
            <h3>Student Completes the Viva</h3>
            <p>
                VivaNoodle guides the student through a structured <strong>text-based</strong> viva — a chat-style 
                conversation that probes the reasoning behind their work. No video calls or scheduling needed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-card">
            <div class="how-number">4</div>
            <h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>
            <p>
                Students receive strengths, misconceptions, and actionable guidance.  
                Staff receive the full conversation, integrity indicators, and summary insights.

<!-- WHY -->
<section id="why" class="section spotlight">
    <h2>The Challenge Facing Higher Education</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
        Generative AI has fundamentally changed how students produce text. Traditional take-home assessments
        no longer give instructors confidence that submitted work reflects student understanding.  
        VivaNoodle offers a constructive way forward.
    </p>

    <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Authenticity by Design</h3>
            <p>
                AI-aware vivas evaluate real reasoning, not polished output. 
                Meaningful explanations cannot be faked by automated tools.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Fairness & Transparency</h3>
            <p>
                Students receive actionable, qualitative feedback.
                No hidden scores. No black-box detection tools.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Signals for Academic Judgement</h3>
            <p>
                Focus shifts, paste events, typing rhythm and timing patterns help contextualise performance 
                without intrusive surveillance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Scalable & Consistent</h3>
            <p>
                Replicate the quality of a traditional viva across large cohorts.
                Consistent tone, depth, and questioning — every time.
